this is a readme file to see how git works
and how adding a file changes git status

I'm still working with the git stuff.
I'm noticing changes in how the editor works

Green lines as I add things. Then blue lines. It's kind of weird.
I THink there will be a ton of stuff I don't understand.

I'm kind of glad I took so long to install git. I think I wouldn't have known
what was normal to git and what was normal to VSCode
